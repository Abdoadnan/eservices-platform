Java 7u21 is ok, but with later releases signature validation ends with
"Cannot resolve element with ID bidSignedData"

The previous code which arbitrarily searched for ID references by the
name of "Id" has been removed because it was insecure and is subject to
XML Signature wrapping attacks.

There are 3 potential workarounds that you can apply:

1. Use a validating schema which will register the elements with ID references.

2. Register the ID elements with the DOMValidateContext.setIdAttributeNS
method before validating the signature

3. Implement a custom URIDereferencer which can find these references
and override the builtin URIDereferencer with the
DOMValidateContext.setURIDereferencer method.

We will open a separate doc bug to have the tutorial fixed.
