# Doccheck Get Started #

Doccheck is a utility for checking signed PDF documents generated by Motrice. It retrieves metadata and checksums from signed documents.

When signing a document in Motrice, you are presented with a document number and a unique checksum. If you get a copy of the document you signed, it should be possible to verify the document number and the check sum, the basis for your signature, independently of Motrice. Doccheck extracts metadata and re-calculates checksums with only superficial knowledge of the PDF format. The code is open and may easily be reproduced in other programming languages.


## Command Line Use ##

You obtain doccheck as a Java jar named `motrice-doccheck-{version}.jar`. Run it from the command line the following way.

```
java -jar motrice-doccheck-{version}.jar [options] pdf-file...
```

The following options are available.

* **-base64, -nobase64**  
 Print (or don't print) checksums in Base64 notation
* **-debug**  
 Run in debug mode, print debug messages
* **-en**  
 Use English for messages
* **-hex, -nohex**  
 Print (or don't print) checksums in hexadecimal notation
* **-meta, -nometa**  
 Print (or don't print) metadata
* **-sv**  
 Use Swedish for messages

The default is equivalent to: `-meta -base64 -sv`

Options are scanned before files are checked. If you specify conflicting options, the last one takes effect.
