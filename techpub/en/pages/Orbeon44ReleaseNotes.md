# Orbeon 4.4.0 What's New #

Selected stuff from the Orbeon 4.4.0 [release notes](http://blog.orbeon.com/2013/11/orbeon-forms-44.html).

Auto-save and owner/group-based permissions introduced, but **only for the relational databases supported by Orbeon**. Thus, the eXist interface is not affected.

Form Runner is more extensible. You may add various logic, JavaScript, and simple processes.

There seems to be changes in the REST API. Links to documentation:

* [Form Runner/Form Builder Persistence API](http://wiki.orbeon.com/forms/doc/developer-guide/form-runner/persistence-api)
* [Supporting permissions in your persistence API implementation](http://blog.orbeon.com/2013/10/supporting-permissions-in-your.html)

Owner/group-based permissions were introduced in 4.3, completed (?) in 4.4.
